While I stayed up for as long as I could on the night of the Oscars, my bleary eyes did catch sight of the quite beautiful graphics that were made for the Best Film title sequences. I particularly enjoyed the transitions made between each nomination. They were designed by <a href="http://www.henryhobson.co.uk/">Henry Hobson</a> together with the animation studio <a href="http://www.elastic.tv/">Elastic</a>. The ones for Birdman and Whiplash had me remember those gorgeous old Hitchcock title sequences for Vertigo and North By Northwest. The latter is a personal favourite. I must remember to watch it again sometime.

Today I also came across the site design for <a href="http://www.dogstudio.be/">Dogstudio</a>. The ink-like transitions between pages are just as illustrative. For instance, try clicking through the nav bar.
