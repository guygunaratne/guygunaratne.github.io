Matias Duarte just concluded an [AMA with LayerVault.](https://news.layervault.com/stories/45342-ama-im-matias-duarte-a-vp-of-design-at-google) There were a number of very interesting insights.

####On focusing on the problem:

> I have a mantra I follow when tackling design projects, which is focus on the problem. Too many times I’ve fallen in love with an idea and wasted a bunch of time. However if you focus on something that’s a problem - something that causes pain or frustration or is an unmet need - you know you’re not just building a fantasy.

Particularly interesting was his frustration with the lack of concensus when it comes to iconography and how this affects adversly on usability:

####Consensus on iconography

>I’ve seen usability study after study that shows the glyphs we currently use cause confusion to first time users. The problem is exacerbated by the reality that our users use a mix of platforms during the day. Asking designers to use text is not an option - these common functions can take up too much space and are often hard to label meaningfully.


####On his design influences: 

> I guess personally I'm most comfortable working in the abstract expressionist school. Gorky and Matta are the painters my work is most similar too. Though my figurative influences are heavily pop cultural ... maybe cross the above two with Takashi Murakami and Audrey Kawasaki?

Here is a Murakami for reference:
