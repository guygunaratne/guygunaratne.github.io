It's an interesting exercise to think of the future as a permeating loop. Where technology flows through every aspect of our lives. Commentators tend to claim similar things about the here and now. Strictly speaking however, this isn't all that true. Technology commands a lot of our time but I think there may be a larger distinction to be made about living *with* technology verses living *within* a technological world. 

I'm reminded of the Peter Theil quote about how smart devices, these amazing technlogoical products that fit into our hands tend to distract us from looking up and noticing that we live in an old world. This holds true for the cities we live in to the transport systems we use and the systems we depend on. 

> There is far, far less innovation in places that don't fit into the palm of your hand.

This is why, for me, videos like this becomes so compelling. It comes from Microsoft and it is being touted as their vision of a future where technology is infused into leisure, home and the workplace. 

I particularly enjoyed seeing interfaces that are designed to fit into what is in essence just an ordinary day despite the showy gizmos. That too, is a compelling challenge. How can we augment an old world without losing all the inherent human fingerprints.
