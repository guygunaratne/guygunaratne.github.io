There was a time when it felt like I'd spent every minute of everyday inside the Adobe Creative Cloud. Editing video in Premiere, designing icons and graphics in Illustrator, generating effects in AE before using dynamic lnking to pull them all together. Since moving into designing for the web however, I've shifted toward spending far more time coding and with that shift came new software and tools. 

Since the beginning of this year for instance I have switched from using Illustrator to design mockups to Sketch3. I always liken that switch to the feeling a few years back when I made the agonising decision to switch from being a long-time Final Cut Pro user to Adobe Premiere to edit video. That particular switch saw immeasurable benefit in the end. In moving to a tool made for my specific skillset, workflow  - FCPX was not to kind on multiple editing projects or sharing sequences between two/three editors which was a requirement with web-series editing - made me much more proficient. In hind-sight it was a no-brainer. It's a good feeling when the tools you use push you out of your comfort zone but also end up making you better at your craft.

I wavered a little recently having spent little or no time editing video and gaining a new set of skills with code. I didn't want to keep paying for a service I no-longer used on a regular basis. But while that made more sense when we were building our product over the winter, now as we shift again for launch in a few weeks I now know that I will be pushing out regular video blogs and other content over the coming months. So I've decided to stick with it. 

All this to say, I'm glad I did, since the new raft of CC updates look very nice indeed. I might have even missed editing a little bit!
