[COADEC](http://www.coadec.com/) are a non-profit made up of tech entreprneurs that support and campaign around policy on behalf of the UK's startup community. I've followed their work and have admired their effectiveness. Today comes news of a win on the stagnant immigration front:

> Some great news for digital startups today as the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) has recommended to the Home Office that several digital roles should be added to the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). We called for this in our Startup Manifesto, and have been campaigning for this change alongside techUK and Tech London Advocates.  The MAC is the expert body that advises the government on migration issues, and its recommendations are almost always implemented. 

They recommend that the following roles, for those with over 5 years experience, should be added to the Shortage Occupation List:

* Product Manager
* Data Scientist
* Senior Developer
* Cyber-Security Specialist
