Ever since I came across a link from [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) the idea of having an annotation layer to the entire web, where anyone could leave a comment on any part of any website, seemed fascinating to me. It chimed with what my initial thoughts on bringing context to video, which has since morphed into [Storygami](www.storygami.com). When [Rap Genius](http://genius.com/Genius-how-to-use-genius-to-make-your-site-annotatable-annotated) exploded a few years back, it seemed like we might actually get the thing that has since been woven into the narrative accumulating around the early days of the web. As this release from the beta-page of (formerly Rap) Genius says:

> Only a handful of people know that the web browser’s big missing feature—the feature that was supposed to be in from the start but didn’t make it—is the ability to annotate any page on the Internet.
With the Genius Beta, it's now possible to add context, commentary, and images directly on top of any web page using only your browser.

Truly can't wait to see where this: [link](http://genius.com/beta?ref=producthunt ) goes.
