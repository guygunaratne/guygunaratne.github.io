When I look to find expertise in a specific discipline I tend to enjoy it far more when learning from someone who possesses a passion and peculiar, fierce human love for the subject matter. 

Be that a teacher, a critic or an artist, it's just more fun when you're listening to someone who is slightly nuts about what they're into. I also tend to trust and return to these rare few when I want to learn more. 

There are equivelents in other crafts - and I do think you can call code a craft, there is an artisinal side to it - but I'm hard pressed to find the same sort of voice in technology, in design or in development in general.  

To give you an idea of what I mean. Here are a few examples from other disciplines:

###Cinema - Mark Cousins 

Mark Cousins is a cinephile of the highest order. He speaks about cinema as if each frame of celluloid is a precious mineral. He makes shapes with his hands and forms his words with the precision of poet. Here he is talking about his *'companion'*:

###Literature - Michael Silverblatt

When it comes to literature, there is no voice I would rather listen to than Michael Silverblatt whose radio show/podcast [KCRW's Bookworm](http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/bookworm/karl-ove-knausgaard-my-struggle-part-ii) which is on regular play on my [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8). His cultural insights are often more interesting than whatever the writers he interviews have to say about their own work. Silverblatt also rarely comes off stuffy and is always gracious about the work - since he actually reads all of the books. Skip to 0:25:

###Art History - Waldemar Januszczak

I don't much go in for art history but I was turned on to it by a friend who had me watch the incredibly geeky [*Tim's Vermeer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS_HUWs9c8c) documentary. I have heard this Januszczak fellow is fun to listen to. He does seem to possess the same degree of mind-boggling knowledge:

Each of these engender a deeper love and understanding about the craft we choose to be a part of. But perhaps it is because programming is a relatively different form. It isn't art but it is a form of expression however way you look at it. Sure there is such a thing as beautiful code but I think I'm trying to get at how we talk about code and development in general. For example, what I find facinating is how Javascript is constructed and thought about as a tool and lanaguage framework. I've only just begun learning but it is what compels me to keep going. 

Logic structure and systems perhaps doesn't lend well to flowering descriptions but then again architecture doesn't seem to suffer for the same. There is more to all this than being a functional way to build things on the web or otherwise and I am surprised at the lack of distinct voices. This is especially true when it comes to the axis of design, technology and society. Perhaps the like heart on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/) needs to be enhanced somehow or perhaps I just haven't turned the corner and found them. 

Thus far the writers and old artisans at [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) have come closest.
