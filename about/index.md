This is where I will post any thoughts about the few things I care and think deeply about. Namely design, technology, literature and politics.


## About Me

I am the co-founder and Head of Product Design at [Storygami.](www.storygami.co) Previously I was a video journalist covering human rights stories around the world, making content for the likes of Al Jazeera, Amnesty International and WarChild UK.
