## About Letters & Code

Posts here will tend toward digressive thoughts about the subjects I spend most of my time thinking about. Namely these are design, technology, literature and politics. These posts will either be a deep dive into either of these or a connection of dots between them all.


## About Me

I am the co-founder and Head of Product Design at [Storygami.](www.storygami.co) Previously I was a video journalist covering human rights stories around the world having made content for the likes of Al Jazeera, Amnesty International and WarChild UK. I also write books in the early hours and live between London and Berlin.
