      <p>For me, writing becomes a process of divining thought patterns. It is almost a kind of striving to settle upon a conscious, cogent and original opinion. Seeking a subjective truth is a deceptively difficult thing to do. So much of what we tend to say about the world can be traced back to heard words and framing found to lay elsewhere. Independent thinking comes down to trusting your own capacity for an original, personal opinion. People are not puppets nor mouthpieces. Nothing comes from adopting an easier path, one of repeating commentary without trusting your own engaged and curious mind. For me, it is worth struggling with ourselves so that an answer has a chance to spring from a place of authenticity and purpose. For me, this is an essential part of offering a responsible perspective.</p>

<p>Last night, just before heading to bed, I came across a post from a friend. The post was a video of ISIS fighters destroying ancient relics that had been housed in Iraq’s Mosul Museum. My initial response would have been similar to most people who had seen the video I imagine; shock, abhorrence, alarm and repulsion. There is violence in this reaction. But it was a violence that feels as if deliberately enticed by what I was watching.</p>

<iframe src="https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/world/video/2015/feb/26/islamic-state-militants-destroy-ancient-iraqi-artefacts-mosul-video" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Now, I haven’t watched the beheading videos released by ISIS. I couldn’t watch the video where Moath al-Kasabeh, the Jordanian pilot was burnt alive. I have seen clips however and I remember noticing the remarkable sophistication of the material, the editing, music and scale of production. They are polished, these videos. Admittedly this is an odd thing to point out but I believe something significant has happened since ISIS has come into power in Syria and Iraq. It is that the language has changed. The channels with which movements like ISIS roll out propaganda have gone beyond the 24 news cycle. These videos are a nightmare cut and packaged for the social stream, made for and of the Internet. We’re now seeing reports of young second generation Muslims leaving parts of the UK and Europe to join ISIS. You can see the compelling aesthetic all over this media campaign and that’s why I’m not surprised. </p>

<p>The violence I felt after watching this video; <em>Bomb them, wipe them out, drone strike them out of existence</em> might be understandable given the destruction. Ancient statues and headstones smashed and toppled into pieces, scattered history, 3000 year old heritage destroyed, art belonging to all of us. It is all too easy to turn initial reactions like these into justifications for some form of retribution. It is harder to move beyond it toward a rational response. So what to do other than to seek out more knowledge, find opinions that you wouldn’t normally agree with and weigh them up against what you feel instinctively. In the days since, I began thinking about why these videos are released in the first place. Why else but to seduce us into hatred and push us toward conflict and yet another cycle? </p>

<p>I’d recommend these for further reading: </p>

<p>Inherent curiosity, self-sought and entirely mysterious at times, often leads to uncomfortable revelations. On many occasions if the subject is worth thinking about it’s because there may be more to what you believe about a certain subject matter than your initial response would reveal. This, perhaps, is where curiosity comes from in a sense; a part of your mind that nags and prods at your conscience in order to bring to the surface something real and of value. I think this may be all the more important when we consider the sophistication of the media machine behind movements like ISIS. Manipulation works, and whether we like it or not we are all susceptible. All the more reason in my mind to struggle with offering genuine thoughts about what we should do.</p>

<p>For me, this was difficult. I have come to the uneasy conclusion that some form of military intervention, a policy I would normally resist vehemently, should be considered given the argument that while ‘taking on’ Al Qaeda was always a misnomer, ISIS is in large part a territorial army and as such could be defeated. The question isn’t one of ‘what good would come of western involvement but one of ‘what option is the less awful.’ Whether a militaristic response would come in the form of a broad multi-national coalition or whether the Iraqi national army is capable of defeating them with help, I don’t know. What I’m far surer about is that we are unlikely to see the same degree of public outcry against militarism, as was the case in 2003 before Western powers engaged in Iraq. I’m also aware that those who wanted to depose of Saddam in the lead up to that war made similar arguments. </p>

<p>It is a sad, tragic and an galling opinion to have come to. This video upsets me deeply and it upsets me more that I’ve come to adopt a position where yet more destruction is an inevitable outcome. But I watch this video, aware of the context, the circumstance around it - knowing full well that ISIS would in the end get what they want: war. The small comfort I have is that it’s an opinion that was hard won and that my liberalism finds great strength in struggling with decisions that ought to be struggled with.</p>
